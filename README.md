# weight-bmi-app
Weight & BMI Predictor is a Machine Learning web application that predicts a person’s weight based on their height.
After prediction, it automatically calculates the BMI and classifies the health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).

The app also stores prediction history, allows users to delete records, and visualizes the relationship between height and predicted weight.

Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit.
